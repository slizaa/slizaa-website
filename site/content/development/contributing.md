You love Slizaa but miss a certain feature? You found a bug and want to report it, or even better, fix it yourself? 

That's great! Slizaa is all open source and your help is highly appreciated.

Slizaa follows the _Fork & Pull_ development approach. To get started just fork a Slizaa repository to your GitHub account and create a new topic branch for each change. A 'topic' branch is a separate branch that you use when working on a single 'topic' (a bug fix, a new feature, or an experimental idea). Once you are done with your change, submit a pull request against the Slizaa repository.
